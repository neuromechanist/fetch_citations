fetch_citations
===============
fetch_citations is a simple interface to Google Scholar to fetch citation numbers and lists.

It is part of the NEMAR project, and is designed to be used in conjunction with the NEMAR database.
However, it can be used independently of the NEMAR project, with any list of queries for which you would like
to fetch citation numbers and lists.

It uses the `scholarly` package to interact with the Google Scholar API.
It also uses the `pandas` package to create and manipulate dataframes. You can install these packages using pip:

    ``` bash
    pip install scholarly pandas
    ```
For the best results, you should also initialize the proxy using the `get_working_proxy` function.
This function requires a paid API key. You can get a key from ScrapreAPI, and then use it to initialize the proxy.

The `get_citation_numbers` function retrieves the total number of citations for a given dataset.
The `get_citations` function retrieves the detailed citation information for a given dataset.
